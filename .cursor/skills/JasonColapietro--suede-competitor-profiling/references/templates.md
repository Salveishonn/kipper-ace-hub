## Evidence Markers

Every filled field in every template below carries one of four markers, so a
reader can tell at a glance what is observed and what is reasoned. This is the
mechanism behind "fact, inference, and unknowns kept separate" — without it a
profile reads as uniformly authoritative regardless of where each line came from.

| Marker | Use for | Example |
|--------|---------|---------|
| `[fact: url, date]` | Anything read directly off a public page or review source | `$49/mo [fact: acme.com/pricing, 2026-03-04]` |
| `[provider estimate: provider, market, device, date]` | Any third-party metric — traffic, authority, keyword counts | `41k/mo [provider estimate: DataForSEO, US, desktop, 2026-03-04]` |
| `[inference]` | Anything reasoned from evidence rather than stated | `Mid-market ops teams [inference]` |
| `[unknown]` | Looked for, not found | `Team size: [unknown]` |

Two terminal states are legitimate and must not be filled with a guess:
`[unknown]` (searched, not found) and `not collected` (out of scope for this
depth level, or no authorized provider available). Never substitute an estimate
for either.
